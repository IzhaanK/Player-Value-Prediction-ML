**Project Description:**

As a football enthusiast, I worked on three unique projects that combine machine learning, exploratory data analysis and player comparison to gain deeper insights into the world of football. These projects aim to provide data-driven solutions for player valuation, performance comparison and exploratory analysis.

### 1. **Player Market Value Prediction:**
In this project, I developed a machine learning model to predict football players' market values based on various performance metrics and attributes. Using advanced regression algorithms like Random Forest and XGBoost, I built a robust system that evaluates player attributes to estimate their market worth with high accuracy.

#### Key Highlights:
- **Feature Engineering:** Extracted key performance metrics such as overall ratings, pace, shooting, and physicality to enrich the predictive model.
- **Model Building:** Utilized regression techniques to create an accurate player valuation system.
- **Impact:** This model helps teams, agents, and analysts assess a player's potential market value and make data-driven decisions.

### 2. **CR7 vs Messi Comparison (Fun Analysis):**
This fun yet insightful project focuses on comparing two of the greatest football players—Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi—using statistical metrics. By aggregating relevant performance attributes such as shooting, dribbling, and physicality, I developed a mathematical model to determine who outperforms the other based on data.

#### Key Highlights:
- **Attribute Comparison:** Compared both players using various metrics to evaluate their strengths.
- **Mathematical Model:** Created an automated system for comparing football players across different attributes.
- **Impact:** The project adds a playful edge to data-driven analysis, sparking discussions around one of football’s greatest debates.

### 3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on FIFA Data:**
In this project, I performed an in-depth exploratory data analysis on FIFA data to uncover insights into player performance and team dynamics. Through data visualization, feature analysis, and statistical methods, I extracted meaningful insights that can help in better understanding player roles and trends in the football world.

#### Key Highlights:
- **Data Exploration:** Conducted detailed EDA to explore player attributes, trends, and distributions.
- **Visualization:** Used plots and dashboards to visualize player stats, providing clear insights into data patterns.
- **Impact:** This analysis offers valuable insights to FIFA gamers, analysts, and football enthusiasts alike, aiding in decision-making around player selection and team strategy.

These projects combine machine learning, data analysis, and football insights, demonstrating my passion for applying technical skills to the sports domain.
